Build a secure and advanced Admin Panel for my Telegram bot project called "PocketCashBot".

The bot is a task/offer based earning platform. I want the admin panel to include the following core features, divided into logical phases:

---

ðŸŸ¨ Phase 1: Authentication & Security

- Admin login page (username + password based)
- Store hashed passwords securely using bcrypt or similar
- Logout functionality
- Middleware/auth check for all protected admin routes

            - Offer status (active/inactive)

                              - Set global bot settings:

                                          Use a clean responsive UI like AdminLTE or Tailwind Admin Kit. Backend can be built in Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js) and should be easy to deploy on Replit, Vercel, or Railway. Store data using Google Sheets or Firebase or MongoDB (whichever is available).

                                          The final admin panel must be connected to the Telegram bot backend using a shared database or API.
